# Emails for when the surf's up

Get notified ahead of time when the swell is coming in.

# In production

[Here](http://natewillard.com/projects/surf_alert/)

## TODOS NECESSARY FOR RELEASE

1. ~~All regions~~
2. ~~Search bar for regions~~
3. Alert-level date range (alert me within X days)
4. Alert-level quality thresholds (forecast is at least X good)
5. Frontend copy -> "Alert me when ~ regional forecast is at least ~ within the next ~ days at ~"
6. ~~Frontend jquery or whatever to alert on missing fields / submission correct~~ (good enough)

## WOULD BE NICE BUT NOT ESSENTIAL
1. Page for unsubs (when they click the link show em something)
2. Move sender email address into config file (blocks open source usage)
3. Write mini usage guide (readme)
4. Code-level todos
